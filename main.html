            <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
            <p><strong>Inception</strong> is a mind-bending science fiction action film that follows Dominic Cobb, a skilled thief who specializes in the dangerous art of **extraction**, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is most vulnerable. Cobb is offered a chance at redemption: his final job is not to steal an idea, but to plant one—a process called **inception**. To succeed, he must assemble a specialized team and descend through multiple layers of a shared dreamscape, all while battling his own tormented past and the projections of his deceased wife, Mal, who haunts his subconscious mind.</p>
